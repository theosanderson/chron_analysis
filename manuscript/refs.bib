              can lead to key insights into its evolution, ecology or
              epidemiology. The tool of choice for such a study is often to
              build a phylogenetic tree, and more specifically when possible a
              dated phylogeny, in which the dates of all common ancestors are
              estimated. Here, we propose a new Bayesian methodology to
              construct dated phylogenies which is specifically designed for
              bacterial genomics. Unlike previous Bayesian methods aimed at
              building dated phylogenies, we consider that the phylogenetic
              relationships between the genomes have been previously evaluated
              using a standard phylogenetic method, which makes our methodology
              much faster and scalable. This two-step approach also allows us
              to directly exploit existing phylogenetic methods that detect
              bacterial recombination, and therefore to account for the effect
              of recombination in the construction of a dated phylogeny. We
              analysed many simulated datasets in order to benchmark the
              performance of our approach in a wide range of situations.
              Furthermore, we present applications to three different real

              genomes to trace local transmission dynamics. However, because
              the viral phylogeny is already so large-and will undoubtedly grow

  abstract = "Phylogenies provide a useful way to understand the evolutionary
              history of genetic samples, and data sets with more than a
              thousand taxa are becoming increasingly common, notably with
              viruses (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)). Dating
              ancestral events is one of the first, essential goals with such
              data. However, current sophisticated probabilistic approaches
              struggle to handle data sets of this size. Here, we present very
              fast dating algorithms, based on a Gaussian model closely related
              to the Langley-Fitch molecular-clock model. We show that this
              model is robust to uncorrelated violations of the molecular
              clock. Our algorithms apply to serial data, where the tips of the
              tree have been sampled through times. They estimate the
              substitution rate and the dates of all ancestral nodes. When the
              input tree is unrooted, they can provide an estimate for the root
              position, thus representing a new, practical alternative to the
              standard rooting methods (e.g., midpoint). Our algorithms exploit
              the tree (recursive) structure of the problem at hand, and the
              close relationships between least-squares and linear algebra. We
              distinguish between an unconstrained setting and the case where
              the temporal precedence constraint (i.e., an ancestral node must
              be older that its daughter nodes) is accounted for. With rooted
              trees, the former is solved using linear algebra in linear
              computing time (i.e., proportional to the number of taxa), while
              the resolution of the latter, constrained setting, is based on an
              active-set method that runs in nearly linear time. With unrooted
              trees the computing time becomes (nearly) quadratic (i.e.,
              proportional to the square of the number of taxa). In all cases,
              very large input trees (>10,000 taxa) can easily be processed and
              transformed into time-scaled trees. We compare these algorithms
              to standard methods (root-to-tip, r8s version of Langley-Fitch
              method, and BEAST). Using simulated data, we show that their
              estimation accuracy is similar to that of the most sophisticated
              methods, while their computing time is much faster. We apply
              these algorithms on a large data set comprising 1194 strains of
              Influenza virus from the pdm09 H1N1 Human pandemic. Again the
              results show that these algorithms provide a very fast
              alternative with results similar to those of other computer
              programs. These algorithms are implemented in the LSD software
              (least-squares dating), which can be downloaded from

  abstract = "The 2013-2016 West African epidemic caused by the Ebola virus was
              of unprecedented magnitude, duration and impact. Here we
              reconstruct the dispersal, proliferation and decline of Ebola
              virus throughout the region by analysing 1,610 Ebola virus
              genomes, which represent over 5\% of the known cases. We test the
              association of geography, climate and demography with viral
              movement among administrative regions, inferring a classic
              'gravity' model, with intense dispersal between larger and closer
              populations. Despite attenuation of international dispersal after
              border closures, cross-border transmission had already sown the
              seeds for an international epidemic, rendering these measures
              ineffective at curbing the epidemic. We address why the epidemic
              did not spread into neighbouring countries, showing that these
              countries were susceptible to substantial outbreaks but at lower
              risk of introductions. Finally, we reveal that this large
              epidemic was a heterogeneous and spatially dissociated collection
              of transmission clusters of varying size, duration and
              connectivity. These insights will help to inform interventions in
              future epidemics.",

abstract = {Phylogenetic trees are essential to evolutionary biology, and numerous methods exist that attempt to extract phylogenetic information applicable to a wide range of disciplines, such as epidemiology and metagenomics. Currently, the three main Python packages for trees are Bio.Phylo, DendroPy, and the ETE Toolkit, but as dataset sizes grow, parsing and manipulating ultra-large trees becomes impractical for these tools. To address this issue, we present TreeSwift, a user-friendly and massively scalable Python package for traversing and manipulating trees that is ideal for algorithms performed on ultra-large trees.}
