This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

perf = read_tsv("performance.tsv",col_names=c("n_tips","seconds"))

perf_for_fit = perf %>% filter(n_tips>500)





ggplot(perf, aes(x=n_tips,y=seconds))+geom_point()+scale_x_log10(limits=c(10,4e6)) + scale_y_log10() +geom_smooth(data=perf_for_fit,method="glm",fullrange=TRUE)


```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
